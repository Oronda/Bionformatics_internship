# Internship
This is Bioinformatics Internship repository

My name is Audrey Oronda, an MBBU Bioinformatics intern at ICIPE. I'm excited to start my research career in genomics and bioinformatics with this internship.

## long term vision
become a bioinformatician in the near future

## short term vision
to gain hands-on experience and knowledge from the talented scientists through training and mentorship.


This is my [roadmap]{https://github.com/Oronda/Bionformatics_internship/blob/main/roadmap.md}
